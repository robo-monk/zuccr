Zuccr is an open source social media app, heavily inspired by Facebook. Built on Ruby on Rails, alongside the curriculum of [TheOdinProject](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

Below, I've listed various key-points I found interesting while developing the app. Feel free to copy any of these.

 This is the initial schema I went with, which later will be expanded to support friend requests, mentions and other types of notifications.
